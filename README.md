## Installation

To run this project locally, you will need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn statsmodels
Dataset
The 50_Startups.csv dataset is used in this project, which contains the following features:

R&D Spend: Amount spent on research and development.
Administration: Amount spent on administration.
Marketing Spend: Amount spent on marketing.
State: Categorical variable representing the state where the startup is based.
Profit: The dependent variable representing the profit made by the startup.
Project Overview
This project applies multiple linear regression to predict startup profit based on the independent variables (R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State).

Steps:
Data Preprocessing:

One-hot encoding is applied to the categorical variable State.
Avoiding the dummy variable trap by removing one dummy variable column.
The dataset is split into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%).
Training the Model:

A multiple linear regression model is fitted to the training set using LinearRegression from sklearn.
Prediction:

The trained model is used to predict the profits on the test set.
The R-squared score is calculated for both the training and test sets.
Model Evaluation:

Train Score: 0.950
Test Score: 0.935
Modeling
One-hot Encoding
The State column is a categorical variable and is transformed using OneHotEncoder. We avoid the dummy variable trap by removing the first column from the encoded matrix.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

ct = ColumnTransformer(transformers=[('encoder', OneHotEncoder(), [3])], remainder='passthrough')
x = np.array(ct.fit_transform(x), dtype=np.float64)
x = x[:, 1:]  # Avoiding the dummy variable trap
Splitting the Dataset
python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
Model Training
python
Copy code
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

regressor = LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(x_train, y_train)
Prediction
python
Copy code
y_pred = regressor.predict(x_test)
Results
Train Score: 0.950
Test Score: 0.935
These values indicate that the model performs well on both the training and test sets.

Backward Elimination
Backward elimination is used to improve the model by removing statistically insignificant variables.

Steps:
Add a column of ones for the intercept.
Use statsmodels to fit the model and perform backward elimination.
python
Copy code
import statsmodels.api as sm

x = np.append(arr=np.ones((x.shape[0], 1)).astype(int), values=x, axis=1)
x_opt = x[:, [0, 3]]  # Select statistically significant variables
regressor_OLS = sm.OLS(endog=y, exog=x_opt).fit()
print(regressor_OLS.summary())

### Explanation:
- Section links in Markdown are automatically converted by taking the section title, making it lowercase, and replacing spaces with hyphens. 
- For example, `# Project Overview` becomes `#project-overview` when linked.

Now the links should work as intended!
